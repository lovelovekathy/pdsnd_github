### Project Title
Using Python to Understand U.S. Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project used Python to calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset. The dataset is a sub-dataset that was randomly selected from a large original dataset that contains bikeshare data in three big cities (i.e., NYC, Chicago, & DC) for the first 6 months in 2017.

The filter functions allow the audiences to build their own filters to view the data and the descriptive statistics based on different cities, months, and days of the month.

The descriptive statistics includes the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trip, the total and average trip duration, and statistics on bikeshare users.

This interactive environment also allows audiences to choose whether or not viewing 5 or more lines of data if they want.

### Files used
Here is the list of the files used:
bikeshare.py -- the python code used for calculating the statistics and building the filters
chicago.csv -- Chicago bikeshare data (not included in the repo)
new_york_city -- NYC bikeshare data (not included in the repo)
washington -- Washington DC bikeshare data (not included in the repo)

### Credits
This project is credited to Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program.
